<p> <strong>Grace Brewster Murray Hopper</strong> (née Murray; December 9, 1906 – January 1, 1992) was an American
   <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_scientist" target="_blank">computer scientist</a> and United States
    Navy rear admiral.[1] <mark>One of the first programmers of the Harvard Mark I computer </mark>, she was a pioneer
     of computer programming who invented one of the first compiler related tools. She popularized the idea of
     machine-independent programming languages, which led to the development of COBOL, an early high-level programming
      language still in use today.</p>

<p> Hopper had attempted to enlist in the Navy during World War II, but she was rejected by the military because
   she was 34 years of age and too old to enlist. She instead joined the Navy Reserves. Hopper began her computing
   career when she worked on the Harvard Mark I team that was led by Howard H. Aiken. In 1949, she joined the Eckert–Mauchly
   Computer Corporation and was part of the development team that designed the UNIVAC I computer in 1944. It was at
   Eckert–Mauchly that she began developing the compiler. She believed that computer code could be written in English
   by using a programming language that was based on English words. The compiler would convert that code into machine
    code that would be understood by computers. By 1952, Hopper finished her compiler, which was written for the A-0
    System programming language.[2][3][4][5]</p>

<p>In 1954, Eckert–Mauchly chose Hopper to lead their department for automatic programming, and she led the release
  of some of the first compiled languages like FLOW-MATIC. In 1959, she participated in the CODASYL consortium, which
   consulted Hopper to guide them in creating a machine-independent programming language. This led to the COBOL language,
   which was inspired by her idea of a language being based on English words. In 1966, she retired from the Naval Reserve,
    but in 1967, the Navy recalled her to active duty. She retired from the Navy in 1986 and found work as a consultant for
     the Digital Equipment Corporation, sharing her computing experiences.</p>

<p>Owing to her accomplishments and her naval rank, she was sometimes referred to as "Amazing Grace".[6][7] The U.S. Navy
   Arleigh Burke-class guided-missile destroyer USS Hopper was named for her, as was the Cray XE6 "Hopper" supercomputer
   at NERSC.[8] During her lifetime, Hopper was awarded 40 honorary degrees from universities across the world. In 1991,
   she received the National Medal of Technology. On November 22, 2016, she was posthumously awarded the Presidential Medal
    of Freedom by President Barack Obama.[9]</p>

<blockquote cite="http://dicocitations.lemonde.fr/citations-auteur-grace_hopper-0.php">
  As quoted in Management and the Computer of the Future (1962) by Sloan School of Management, p. 277- to me
  programming is more than an important practical art. It is also a gigantic undertaking in the foundations of
   knowledge. - Grace Hopper
